- 👋 Hi, I’m @Okkomonkki
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of stuff - philosophy, sports, arts, popular science, bicycles and the forest. Professionally I am an object-theatre artist, sound-engineer and a musician.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, like from total basics. Honestly I'm here just out of curiosity for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on performing arts, sound art and profoundly useless projects.
- 📫 How to reach me - there's a way on github? No way I'm putting my email publicly on a site I just joined :D
